## GitHub Documents

This is an *R* **Markdown** *format* used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to *GitHub* is generated.

## Including Code

You can include **R code** in the document as follows:

```{r babynames}
summary(babynames)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, *for example*:

```{r}
# Code from ModernDive 2.7, Figure 2.18. 
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
